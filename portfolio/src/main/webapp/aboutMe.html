    		<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Where I'm From </h2>
    	    <p> 
                I grew up in the suburbs 30 minutes out of Cleveland, Ohio in a city named Solon. My school was a 30 minute drive
                from there, so I didn't have many friends in the area. My family was a racial minority in the neighborhood, and the
                same has been true for me throughout my education. I'm not very attatched to the area, but I am a Cleveland sports fan
                (as difficult as that is sometimes).

    		<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Family </h2>
    	    <p> 
                I grew up with my mother, father, and sister in the house, and my grandparents have lived very close to us for a 
                large part of my life. Immediately after school, the bus would drop me off at my grandparents' home where I
                would wait with my sister and cousins for my parents to finish work and pick us (my sister and I) up. As you will
                likely be able to tell from the photo section, family is very important to me.

        	<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Personality </h2>
        	<p> 
                I think being/feeling very different everywhere I have been has shaped the bulk of my personality. I don't like to take
                things too seriously (except for this page apparently), but I'm often ambitious to prove myself. The main values I focus 
                on are empathy, growth, and honesty. I'm fairly introverted and shy, but I really enjoy presenting and performing, probably 
                in relation to the aforementioned ambition. When working I often like to get a general outline and direction and then dive in
                and see what I can do, returning to/changing the outline only when I cannot figure out the next step. I think that's just about 
                everything important to know...oh, and I hate cats, bugs, and mascots...okay yeah, that's all.

    		<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Why CS? </h2>
    	    <p> 
                I've always enjoyed puzzles and problem-solving, and computer science is a widely practical field where I can solve puzzles
                and problems. My dad has two computer engineering degrees and has always been very interested in CS, but I only began considering
                it a possible career field in my last year of high school when I took my first programming courses. I'm not sure exactly what I 
                want to do with CS, but that's part of why I like the field in that I have a freedom to choose. I'm also sure that I eventually 
                want to be able to give back some of what I learn in the field to more people that look like me. I'm not sure if that will be a tutoring
                program or mentorship or something else, but I do plan to figure it out soon.
