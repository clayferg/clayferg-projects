    <div id="map"></div>
	<div class="sections">
	  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Where I'm From </h2>
		<p>
		  I grew up in the suburbs 30 minutes out of Cleveland, 
          Ohio in a city named Solon. My school was a 30 minute drive
		  from there, so I didn't have many friends in the area. 
          My family was a racial minority in the neighborhood,
		  and the same has been true for me throughout my education. 
          I'm not very attatched to the area, but I am a Cleveland sports fan
		  (as difficult as that is sometimes).
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="sections">
	  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Family </h2>
		<p>
		  I grew up with my mother, father, and sister in the house,
          and my grandparents have lived very close to us for a
		  large part of my life. Immediately after school, the bus
          would drop me off at my grandparents' home where I
		  would wait with my sister and cousins for my parents to 
          finish work and pick us (my sister and I) up. As you
		  will likely be able to tell from the photo section, 
          family is very important to me.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="sections">
	  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Personality </h2>
	  <p>
		I think being/feeling very different everywhere 
        I have been has shaped the bulk of my personality. I don't
		like to take things too seriously (except for this page apparently),
        but I'm often ambitious to prove myself. The main
		values I focus on are empathy, growth, and honesty. I'm fairly introverted 
        and shy, but I really enjoy presenting and performing, probably
		in relation to the aforementioned ambition. When working I often like to 
        get a general outline and direction and then dive in and see what I can do, 
        returning to/changing the outline only when I cannot figure out 
        the next step. I think that's just about
		everything important to know...oh, and I hate cats, bugs, and mascots
        ...okay yeah, that's all.
      </p>

	<div class="sections">
	  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Why CS? </h2>
	  <p>
		I've always enjoyed puzzles and problem-solving, 
        and computer science is a widely practical field where I can solve puzzles
		and problems. My dad has two computer engineering degrees and has always 
        been very interested in CS, but I only began considering it a possible career 
        field in my last year of high school when I took my first programming courses. 
        I'm not sure exactly what I want to do with CS, but that's part of why I like 
        the field in that I have a freedom to choose. I'm also sure that I eventually
		want to be able to give back some of what I learn in the field to more people 
        that look like me. I'm not sure if that will be a tutoring
		program or mentorship or something else, but I do plan on figuring it out soon.
